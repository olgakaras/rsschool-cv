## 💾 Code example

__Square Every Digit from CODEWARS:__ <i>In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them. For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.  
__Note:__ The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.</i>

```javascript
function squareDigits(num){
  let count = num.toString();
  let res = [];
  for (let i=0; i<count.length; i++){
    res.push(parseInt(count[i]));
    res[i] = res[i] * res[i];
  }
  res = +res.join('');
  return res;
}
```
